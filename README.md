#### Note on Paths

In this file, directory paths are written with a forward slash as on MacOS, Linux, and the Windows-Bash shell: `/dir1/dir2/somefile`.    


## Basics

1. When using Git locally, what are these?  Define each one in a sentence
   * Staging area - File that wait to be committed.
   * Working copy - All files in working directory of local repository.
   * master - Default branch in repository.
   * HEAD - Pointer that tell current branch.

2. When you install git on a new machine (or in a new user account) you should perform these 2 git commands to tell git your name and email.  These values are used in commits that you make:
   ```
   # Git configuration commands for a new account
   git config --global user.name "Name Surname"
   git config --global user.email name@gmail.com
   ```

3. There are 2 ways to create a local Git repository.  What are they?
   - create new repository in your current directory by using command
     ```
     git init
     ```
   
   - clone or copy remote repository to your directory by using use command
     ```
     git clone
     ```

4. When you create a git repository by entering `git init`, Git will create a "hidden" directory for the local repository.  Where is the directory for this local repository (relative to the directory where you typed "git init")?
   ```
   .git
   ```


## Adding and Changing Things

Suppose your working copy of a repository contains these files and directories:
```
README.md
out/
    a.exe
src/a.py
    b.py
    c.py
test/
    test_a.py
    ...
```

1. Add README.md and *everything* in the `src` directory to the git staging area.
   ```
   git add README.md src
   ```

2. Add `test/test_a.py` to the staging area (but not any other files).
   ```
   git add test/test_a.py
   ```

3. List the files in the staging area.
   ```
   README.md
   src/a.py
   src/b.py
   src/c.py
   test/test_a.py
   ```

4. Remove `README.md` from the staging area. (Useful if you accidentally add something you don't want to commit.)
   ```
   git rm --cached README.md
   ```

5. Commit everything in the staging area to the repository.
   ```
   git commit
   ```

6. Describe 2 steps to configure the repository so git will ignore all files in the `out/` directory:
   - step one: create .gitignore file in top-level directory, you can also use this command to create
     ```
     touch .gitignore
     ```
   - step two: tell git to ignore directory by using pattern
     ```
     # ignore all files in directory name out
     out/
     ```
     and add `.gitignore` to the repository
     ```
     git add .gitignore
     git commit -m "add .gitignore"
     ```

7. Command to move all the .py files from `src` to the top-level directory of this repository, so they are also moved in the Git repo.
   ```
   git mv src/*.py .
   ```

8. Commit this change with the message "moved src directory":
   ```
   git commit -m "moved src directory"
   ```

9. Command to add **all changed files** (but not untracked files) to the staging area using a single command.
   ```
   git add -u
   ```
10. **Delete** the file `c.py` from your working copy **and** the repository:
    ```
    git rm c.py
    git commit -m "deleted c.py"
    ```


## Undo Changes and Recover Files


1. Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the `a.py` in the *local repository* (HEAD revision):
   ```
   git diff
   ```
2. Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the version in the *staging area*. (But, if a.py is not in the staging area this will compare working copy to HEAD revision):
   ```
   git diff
   ```
3. **View changes to be committed:** Display the differences between files in the staging area and the versions in the repository. (You can also specify a file name to compare just one file.) 
   ```
   git diff --staged
   ```

4. **Undo "git add":** If `main.py` has been added to the staging area (`git add main.py`), remove it from the staging area:
   ```
   git restore --staged main.py
   ```

11. **Recover a file:** Command to replace your working copy of `a.py` with the most recent (HEAD) version in the repository.  This also works if you have deleted your working copy of this file.
    ```
    git checkout -- a.py
    ```

12. **Undo a commit:** Suppose you want to discard some commit(s) and move both HEAD and "master" to an earlier revision (an earlier commit)  Suppose the git commit graph looks like this (`aaaa`, etc, are the commit ids)
    ```
    aaaa ---> bbbb ---> cccc ---> dddd [HEAD -> master]
    ``` 
    The command to reset HEAD and master to the commit id `bbbb`:
    ```
    git reset --hard bbbb
    ```


7. **Checkout old code:** Using the above example, the command to replace your working copy with the files from commit with id `aaaa`:
   ```
   git checkout aaaa
   ```
    Note:
    - Git won't let you do this if you have uncommitted changes to any "tracked" files.
    - Untracked files are ignored, so after doing this command they will still be in your working copy.
 

## Viewing Commits

1. Show the history of commits, using one line per commit:
   ```
   git log --oneline
   ```
   Some versions of git have an *alias* "log1" for this (`git log1`).

2. Show the history (as above) including *all* branches in the repository and include a graph connecting the commits:
   ```
   d0436fb (HEAD -> master) deleted c.py
   c21ccb2 moved src directory
   f59cd30 add git ignore
   9131226 first files
   
   9131226 ---> f59cd30 ---> c21ccb2 ---> d0436fb [HEAD -> master]
   
   ```

3. List all the files in the current branch of the repository:
   ```
   .gitignore
   README.md
   a.py
   b.py
   test/test_a.py
   test/test_b.py
   out/a.exe
   src/
   ```
   example output:
   ```
   .gitignore
   README.md
   a.py
   b.py
   test/test_a.py
   test/test_b.py
   ```


## Branch and Merge

1. Create a new branch named `dev-foo`:
   ```
   git branch dev-foo
   ```
 
3. Display the name of your current branch:
   ```
   git branch --show-current
   ```

5. List the names of **all** branches, including remote branches:
   ```
     dev-foo
   * master
   ```

7. Switch your working copy to the branch named `dev-foo`:
   ```
   git checkout dev-foo
   ```

9. **Merge:** To merge the work from `dev-foo` into the master branch, perform these steps:
   1. step one : switched from branch `dev-foo` to branch `master`
      ```
      git checkout master
      ```
   2. step two : merge branch `dev-foo` into branch `master`
      ```
      git merge dev-foo
      ```


6. Describe under what conditions a merge may fail.
   ```
   - When directory have file in staging area or have changes that didn't commit.
   - When committed changes the part of the same file from two people or two branches.
   ```



## Favorites

Command to restore file in staging area is very useful when you add wrong file to staging area and don't want to commit it.
```
git restore --staged <file>
```
